## About utility
EncypherUtil is written on Python 3 and using [PyCryptodome](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome) module. Utility uses AES (in EAX, SIV, GCM, OCB, CBC, OFB, CFB modes) and RSA (to encrypt key or whole file) algorithms. All en/decypher functions was written to separate module, so it makes modification easier to do.

Yet it has no interface, but it is planned to make both CLI and GUI(maybe will use PyQT).

Precompiled version will be present for Windows (Linux if I'll have enough time).

Don't hesitate to make your remark, it will be usefull to me.
