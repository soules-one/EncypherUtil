## About utility
EncypherUtil is written on Python 3 and using [PyCryptodome](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome) module. All en/decypher functions was written to separate module, so it makes modification easier to do.
Yet it has no interface, but it is planned to make both CLI and GUI(maybe PyQT).
Compiled version will be present for Windows (Linux if I'll have enough time).
Don't hesitate to make your remark, it will be usefull to me.
